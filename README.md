AVLTree
=======
Managing data structures was interesting to me, so I started this project to learn how I might balance a changing binary search tree. The AVLTree was the easiest method, so I started here. This is not meant to prove that the AVL method works in all cases; the proof for the AVL Tree's effectiveness was published in a paper in 1962. Instead, this project was an attempt to rediscover the effectiveness of AVL Trees for myself. The code is my own, but the theory came from some textbook I found online.
